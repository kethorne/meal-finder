# Project Name

Meal Finder

# Project Description

Javascript project that that calls different endpoints of an API and returns 
recipes for meals based on a search term or by choosing the random button

# Why I Built It

It gave me more practice creating objects and arrays and accessing the data 
in the objects and arrays, even data that is nested. Being able to display the data
correctly. Pulling data from an API call and displaying certain items from
the data.

# What I Would Do Next

I would change the layout a little and possibly display the recipe right 
away instead of having to click on the meal. I might display more than one 
random meal. I would add the option to print the recipe once it's displayed.

# What I Learned

I learned how to call more than one API endpoint and the use template 
literals to display the corect information.

# Stack Information

* HTML
* CSS
* Vanilla Javascript
* API
* Fetch

# How To Use It

Upon open of the page a search bar is availble to search for a term and a 
random button is next to the search bar for the option to choose a random 
meal. Either a single meal is returned from the random button a list of 
available meals is returned from the search term. When a user clicks on the 
desired meal the recipe for instructions and an ingredient list is displayed 
for the user.
